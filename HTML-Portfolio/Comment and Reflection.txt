Comment:
It took me 50 minutes to finish because some parts are already what I did on the previous activity.

Reflection:
I had a difficult time with identifying the semantics of <main>, <footer> and etc.
Another one was indentation, like the <hr> and <br>.
I should study and focus more about those.
