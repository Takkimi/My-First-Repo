Comment:
It took me about an hour because I had to take a break but it might have took me about 30 minutes without one.

Reflection:
I did not really faced any notable challenges but there is one confusion I keep getting.
Because I am more familiar with using div and not the semantic versions, I tend to use that instead.
But I do realize it at the end and changed them. I am also a bit confused about the "groupings"
where I am supposed to indent especially on the <br> and <hr> one.
I learned a lot especially about keeping my codes organized.
