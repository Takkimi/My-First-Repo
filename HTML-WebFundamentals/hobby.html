    <h1>Digital Art: My Escape from Reality</h1>

    <h2>Why I Love Digital Art</h2>
    <p>Digital art allows me to express my creativity without the limitations of traditional mediums. Ever since I was young, art has always been an interest of mine and I always found art material expensive. But due to my eagerness to be able to draw even with limitations, I found out about digital medium.</p>
   
    <p>It gives me the stage to create my imaginations and live with them. I've always loved reading. I remembered back before the pandemic, I always read in Wattpad and other reading websites. I especially love reading Webtoons and Manga.</p>
